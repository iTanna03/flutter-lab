# 🧪 Flutter Lab

Welcome to **Flutter Lab** – a playground where experiments with Flutter widgets, patterns, and
crazy ideas come to life.  
Think of it as a lab notebook for Flutter… but with fewer explosions and more `hot reload`.

## 🔬 What is this?

A collection of Flutter experiments, proofs-of-concept, and small demos.  
Here I explore:

- 🖼️ UI/UX experiments
- 🏗️ Design patterns & architecture
- 🎮 Game prototypes
- 🌀 Weird ideas that *may* or *may not* work

---

## 🚀 Why?

Because Flutter deserves more mad science.  
And because quick hacks are fun, but **clean experiments** teach more.

---

## 🧩 Structure

Each experiment lives in its own folder with:

- `README.md` (what it does)
- Flutter project (the experiment itself)
